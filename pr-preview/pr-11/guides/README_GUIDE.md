This guide assists you in creating a compelling and concise README for your project. It provides
step-by-step guidance on introducing your project and providing essential information for setting
up and running your application.

> [!Note]
> Customize this template according to the specific needs of your projects. Add or remove sections
> based on the nature of each project.

# `<Project Name>` <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Introduce your project with a clear overview of its goals, providing essential context and
addressing fundamental questions.

> [!Tip]
> Enhance your project's visual appeal with a representative image and badges.
> Explore [Adding workflow badges][workflow-badges] for guidance. If your project is an application,
> include production version links (e.g., app store links) and incorporate screenshots to showcase
> its appearance.

> [!Warning]
> Avoid adding a table of contents unless it serves a specific purpose, as GitHub generates one
> automatically.
