# Code of Conduct Guide

Promote a welcoming and safe environment for discussions and contributions.

## Picking a Code of Conduct

The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) provides a great Code of Conduct. Except if you want to write your own you should simply adopt it.

## Adding a Code of Conduct

Add a file called `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to your repository with the text of the Code of Conduct you chose. GitHub automatically adds a link to this file in the _About_ section of your repository homepage.
