# Code of Conduct Guide

To promote a welcoming and safe environment for discussions and contributions your repository should include a code of conduct.

## Picking a Code of Conduct

The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) provides a sound code of conduct.

## Adding a Code of Conduct

Add a file called `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to the repository with the text of the Code of Conduct you chose. GitHub automatically adds a link to this file in the _About_ section of your repository homepage.
