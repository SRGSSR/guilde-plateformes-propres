# Code of Conduct Guide

Promote a welcoming and safe environment for discussions and contributions.

## Picking a Code of Conduct

The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) provides a great Code of Conduct. You can use it as-is, adapt it to your needs, or write your own document.

## Adding a Code of Conduct

Add a file called `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to the root of your repository, the `docs` folder, or the `.github` folder, with the text of the Code of Conduct you chose. GitHub automatically adds a link to this file in the _About_ section of your repository homepage.
