# Contributing Guide

Provide more context about contributions you are looking for and how they should occur.

## Writing Contributing guidelines

Writing Contributing guidelines depends on your project and how your team decides to process contributions. To help you:

- The [Pillarbox Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-apple/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) is an example describing which contributions are considered, how they should occur (with links to the corresponding templates) and how they will be processed.
- The following [template](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template) can be used if you need to write Contributing guidelines tailored to your needs.

## Adding Contributing guidelines

Add a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` to your repository with the text you wrote. GitHub automatically adds a link to this file in the _About_ section of your repository homepage.
