# License Guide

Providing license information in your code repository is essential ensure the conditions applicable to your project are transparent.

## Choosing a license

The following [online guide](https://choosealicense.com/) is an excellent way to pick a license.

## Adding a license

Add a file called `LICENSE` to the repository with the text of the license you chose. GitHub automatically adds a link to this file in the _About_ section of your repository homepage.

You can either repeat the license in each file requiring it but this is generally cumbersome. To make your life easier you can use the following reduced license instead, which points to the main license file for more information:

```
//
//  Copyright (c) SRG SSR. All rights reserved.
//
//  License information is available from the LICENSE file.
//
```
