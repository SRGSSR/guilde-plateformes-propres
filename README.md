# RTS Development Guidelines

A guide for promoting best practices among RTS code repositories.

## Introduction

The software industry is constantly evolving. Our own practices should similarly evolve to disseminate knowledge throughout teams, share ownership, make it easier for newcomers to start and for more seasoned developers to contribute to any project.

## Guides

The following guides are offered to help you improve your repository:

- [README Guide](docs/guides/README_GUIDE.md): Write a great introductory text for your repository.
- [Contributing Guide](docs/guides/CONTRIBUTING_GUIDE.md): Ensure smooth collaboration and contribution to your project by providing a clear guide on how others can contribute.
- [Code of Conduct Guide](docs/guides/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_GUIDE.md): Provide a code of conduct to ensure everyone can safely contribute.
- [License Guide](docs/guides/LICENSE_GUDE.md): Pick an appropriate license.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. To get started, please read our [Contribution Guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or share your ideas.
